# Weapon and key value modding


## Weapon Modding

Do keep in mind that these are usually changed server-side.

To actually change the keyvalues of weapons you'd have to name them appropriately inside a mod folder
For example: `R2Northstar\mods\Northstar.Custom\keyvalues\scripts\weapons`
You can find all the weapon keyvalues [here](https://github.com/BigSpice/TitanFall_2_Weapon_Skin_Modding/tree/main/Weapon_Scripts)

Example for modding crossshairs using keyvalues: [crosshairmodding](crosshairmodding.md)

- Mod Examples:

  - [Northstar.Custom](https://github.com/R2Northstar/NorthstarMods/tree/main/Northstar.Custom)
  - [Unholy Trinity](https://github.com/xamionex/xamionex.UnholyTrinity)
  - [Kraber9K](https://github.com/Steveplays28/kraber9k)
